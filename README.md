This repository contains the data and code used for the project "Leveraging AI To Automate MLB Roster Construction; Using High Fidelity Synthetic Data To Optimize Team Performance"

Abstract:
This project utilizes artificial intelligence chatbots to generate high-fidelity synthetic data for Major League Baseball hitters and their statistics over a season. The AI evaluates each player based on a five-tool scale, comparing their abilities to one another. Finally, optimization techniques are applied to select an optimal set of thirteen hitters (half of a MLB full roster of twenty-six players), maximizing overall performance while adhering to a specified salary cap. The operating hypothesis is that artificial intelligence can effectively generate high-fidelity synthetic data for baseball hitters and evaluate player performance based on a five-tool scale, given a large influx of data. By applying optimization techniques, it is possible to construct a competitive baseball team that maximizes overall performance while staying within a given salary cap, mirroring real-world decision-making in sports management.
